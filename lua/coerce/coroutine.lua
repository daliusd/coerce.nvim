--- A module with utilities for coroutines.
local M = {}

--- Converts a callback-based function to a coroutine function.
---
--- A coroutine function is a function (not a coroutine/thread) that must be run
--- within a coroutine as it may use coroutine facilities such as yielding.
---
--- The point of this conversion is to allow the programmer to write code that
--- looks synchronous. That is only possible when the programmer works within a
--- coroutine that can be transparently paused.
---
---@tparam function f The function to convert. The callback needs to be its
---                   first argument.
---@treturn function A coroutine function. Accepts the same arguments as f
---                  without the callback. Returns what f has passed to the
---                  callback.
M.cb_to_co = function(f)
	local f_co = function(...)
		local this = coroutine.running()
		assert(this ~= nil, "The result of cb_to_co must be called within a coroutine.")

		local f_status = "running"
		local f_ret = nil
		-- f needs to have the callback as its first argument, because varargs
		-- passing doesnâ€™t work otherwise.
		f(function(ret)
			f_status = "done"
			f_ret = ret
			if coroutine.status(this) == "suspended" then
				local _, cb_ret = coroutine.resume(this)
				return cb_ret
			end
		end, ...)
		if f_status == "running" then
			-- Yield control and wait for the callback to resume it.
			coroutine.yield()
		end
		return f_ret
